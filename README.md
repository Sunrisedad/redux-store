## Installation



## Usage 

* GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
* WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
* THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
* WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
* THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
* WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
* THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
* WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
* THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
* WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
* THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
